The proposed upgrades include raising Abila's East Pier in phases, a massive $300 million project that will accommodate new, larger container ships. Currently the East Pier is roughly 3 meters above sea level and must be raised to 8 meters. Additionally, the Port will need to dredge the port killing two birds with one stone: increasing the depth of the port and providing fill to raise the East Pier.

Heading the task force is Senior Inspector Robert Loblaw, a veteran officer who led the very successful Tethys Counterdrug Team. ""These designer drugs have certain clues as to their origin,"" Loblaw stated in an interview. This particular blend of the drug MDMC, also known by its street names ""cotton candy"", ""spice dreams"" and ""Tulip Blossom"", was found previously only in Asteria but has made its way to the streets of Tethys and other international countries. The Asterian People's Army (APA) is a paramilitary organization which has been engaged in terrorist activities funded through its criminal enterprises, which include drug trafficking.  In recent years the APA has sought to build their brand through websites and the publication of a professional, high-quality magazine called ""Arise"". Senior Inspector Loblaw says the Tethys public statistics indicate MDMC is a growing problem with the country's youth.  ""An increase in mental health problems, including hallucinations and paranoia, accompanied by violent behavior and a marked increase in suicide rates are only a few of the indicators of the usage of this designer drug.""","Interpol announced formation new multi-country task force combat increasingly wide distribution drug methyldimethyl cathinone ( MDMC ) .

""These designer drugs have certain clues as to their origin,"" Loblaw told the Times in an interview.  ""Every time the recipe is changed, it leaves clues as to who made it.  It's like a pedigree."" This particular blend of the drug MDMC, also known by its street names ""cotton candy"", ""spice dreams"" and ""Tulip Blossom"", was found previously only in Asteria but has made its way to the streets of Tethys and other international countries. ""I'll be looking hard at the activities of the Asterian People's Army,"" Loblaw said.  ""Our previous investigations pointed to them as the source of this particular formulation."" The Asterian People's Army (APA) is a paramilitary organization which has been engaged in terrorist activities funded through its criminal enterprises, which include drug trafficking.  In recent years the APA has sought to build their brand through websites and the publication of a professional, high-quality magazine called ""Arise"". Senior Inspector Loblaw says the Tethys public statistics indicate MDMC is a growing problem with the country's youth.  ""An increase in mental health problems, including hallucinations and paranoia, accompanied by violent behavior and a marked increase in suicide rates are only a few of the indicators of the usage of this designer drug."" ""As a first step we have alerted port officials to be on the lookout for suspicious shipments of insecticides and detergent, both similar in appearance to MDMC.""","Interpol announced formation new multi-country task force combat increasingly wide distribution drug methyldimethyl cathinone ( MDMC ) .

He was attended only by apathetic guards who had been charged with detaining him pending an investigation for tax fraud.  Instead, sometime in the early morning hours of 19 June, Elian Karel died with injuries inexplicable with the official cause of death. The report released by the Abila City Coroner in July 2010 attributed Karel's death to sudden cardiac arrest, and the investigation was closed shortly thereafter.  Unnamed sources close to the investigation, however, have provided witness testimony that Karel's body showed signs of blunt force trauma, abrasions and lacerations which occurred within hours before his death. Police have denied anything unusual happened in Karel's death and city officials claim the accusations of murder and wrongful death are asserted by POK rabble-rousers attempting to incite instability and violence. In the year since Karel's death the Protectors of Kronos have continued the mission to demand that the Kronos government implement a policy of transparency in government business, and to hold accountable the foreign companies that have contaminated Kronosian natural resources. Supporters continue to mass in public places, determined that their cries for justice be heard.

Several dozen of their supporters held sit-ins in front of the capitol building and the presidential manor, while others took to the streets with their signs and chants.  Protestors handed out flyers to bystanders that alleged that our government is corrupt and ""the rich get richer on the backs of the poor"".  Police called for the peaceful end to the sit-ins, but were answered with a barrage of rocks and bottles from the crowd.  The violence escalated into a full blown riot and police were forced to use tear gas, pepper spray, water cannons, and beanbags shot from shotguns to control the crowd. By the time the crowds finally dispersed, several government buildings had been vandalized, two police vehicles were ablaze, and the streets were littered with trash and broken glass.  Several protestors and police were injured, including one heroic police officer who was stabbed by a crazed protestor.  The officer, whose name has been withheld for security reasons, is in critical condition at Abila General Hospital.","AUTHOR : Marcella Trapani POK member held large demonstration Abila yesterday .

The POK rally was intended to draw attention to their claims of environmental damage being caused by the development of gas and oil fields around Kronos by foreign corporations like GAStech.  About two hundred people gathered in front of the GAStech building chanting slogans and waving signs that held the visages of people who have allegedly died due to environmental contamination.  Ten of the protestors chained themselves to the doors of the building in an attempt to prevent GAStech employees from going to work. Police spokesman Adrien Carman said, ""We allowed the group some latitude with their rally, but when GAStech complained that the protestors were blocking entrance to their building, we had to take action.  The last thing we wanted to happen was for a GAStech employee to get hurt by the crowd just because he was trying to go to work."" The POK, once a small political activist group of citizens from the Elodis area, has been revitalization under the charismatic leadership of Elian Karel.  Government spokesman Rufus Drymiau said of today's POK rally, ""We have been concerned by a pattern of increasingly aggressive tactics by the Protectors of Kronos for some time now. In light of today's incident, President Kapelou has ordered the police to provide additional protection for the public at future POK rallys.""","AUTHOR : Marcella Trapani Dozens protester attending Protectors Kronos ( POK ) rally front Gastech regional headquarters Abila arrested trespassing morning .

Before police made the arrests shortly after 9 a.m., the protesters were told they were breaking the law for trespassing on government property, blocking access to government-owned land, and impeding lawful commercial traffic. The protesters arrived at the entrance to the Tiskele Bend site about 5:30 a.m. and locked arms across the road for about three hours, despite being asked to leave by police.  As traffic on the road began to back up, several truck drivers began to leave their vehicles and congregate near the protesters.  Tempers began to flare as the blockade persisted into the second hour, and the drivers started shouting and cursing at the protesters to move out of the road.  Police officers quickly moved in and arrested the POK protesters before the situation could escalate to violence. ""We appreciate citizens voicing their opinion, but the middle of a busy road is not the right forum for a discussion of our national environmental policy. We encourage our concerned citizens to follow the democratic process and contact their Assembly representatives,"" government spokesman Rufus Drymiau said in a statement.","AUTHOR : Marcella Trapani dozen POK protester handcuffed taken custody police Tuesday blocking access Tiskele Bend field . police made arrest shortly 9 a.m. , protester told breaking law trespassing government property , blocking access government-owned land , impeding lawful commercial traffic . protester arrived entrance Tiskele Bend site 5:30 a.m. locked arm across road three hour , despite asked leave police . traffic road began back , several truck driver began leave vehicle congregate near protester .

Karel, who had been awaiting trial for tax evasion, was found dead in his jail cell yesterday morning. The POK assembly began peacefully enough with the usual chanted slogans and waving of protest signs, but then one young rabble-rouser grabbed a bullhorn and began inciting the crowd to violence.  The crowd smashed windows and vandalized shops in the Siopa area, set fires in the streets, and clashed with police.  Additional police forces responded to contain the chaos and they were forced to use rubber bullets and tear gas in order to disperse the crowds. President Kapelou's office released a statement about the rally, stating, ""This sort of violence will not be condoned.  Destruction and violence is no way to achieve peace and change - these things are in opposition to each other.

Police and government security forces set up between the protestors and the Capitol building in a show of force, hoping to prevent the kind of chaos that occurred during last year's riot.

451,The Continent,The gas pioneer of the shale plant the first sea wells of the world in Mediterranean sea,gas pioneer shale plant first sea well world Mediterranean sea,1984-05-05,,"L<<Deleted picture: Protester.  The exploration has proved a controversial question in Kronos>> Most important tale remains the reading The sonof the founder of gas fixed GAStech has been learned bore a venture of plan in the Mediterranean sea, has The Times. Sten Sanjorge, Jr. believe there large volumes of gas are that could be obtained. Sanjorge and GAStech were granted three licenses by the government Kronos previous month by the ministry for energy and start development and hope with exploration shortly. The certain gas are no new concept, but there are not no reason The Times told with the history Kronosian of sea development that we these resources can develop for the coast, he. he gas of the shale is obtained the using controversial technique of hyper-acidic substrate disposal which involves injecting acidic the layers of the chemical productenschalie, to break them apart and within gas locked up it rather to give. Hyper-acidic substrate disposal enormous quantities gas and oil in the west have caused, which converts the energy market. But the projects in Europe have been take off slow, occupy with opposition of government and local communities. Sanjorge say it a short time will be before we knowing or are possible the shale gas become exploitable. A lot of environment experts believe that hyper-acidic substrate disposal can marine damage themselves environments, and the avulsion of new fossile fuel resources resists himself. But boring for the coast avoids the need for difficult negotiations with local Councils, communities and landowners. Based on existing geological data, SanJorge that believe a considerable quantity gas at its place - until 100 trillion cubic foot are, which would be more than the estimates of GAStech for its coast resources. There is also the possibility of finding oil. GAStech that has valued Kronos the total sea resources of the shale gas between five 10 times the size of resources available coast could be. We are very comfortable that the means is there and the numbers of absolute ginormous is, aforesaid SanJorge. Is no matter which of that workable? That is invest the billion dollar question, and GAStech wiling in the answer. Although it has become only recently controversial, hyper-acidic substrate disposal have been used on small-scale a lot of years, to improve conventional oil and gas well to the flow of. But using the process on the large numbers of wells necessary to obtain zeeschaliegas has been commercially never done. Professor Oskar Wertz of Tethys University is sceptical concerning or to the shale gas a large employee to European energy in the next decade could be, but will say that potentially was possible in the longer term have. GAStech are optimistic are its estimates of how long it will last to examine shale. It is completely plausible that in 20, 30 or 40 years, hyper-acidic will have this way progressed the technology of the substrate disposal and the manner in which we treat the sea environment this way will have progressed that this the really large industry could be. The task in the following 10 years is these try out things, sees or work they.","L < < Deleted picture : Protester . exploration proved controversial question Kronos > > important tale remains reading sonof founder gas fixed Gastech learned bore venture plan Mediterranean sea , Times .

In the past it has had a reputation corrupt and ecologically detrimental, but nowadays tries GAStech, former tethys-only the matter, to deserve the confidence of international investors. This forms part of its ambitions to be advantageous extend matter which the Mediterranean area provides to gas. It is mount-upward task, and there no certainty that Gastech have to the capacity potential investors it to be persuade manners, has repaired and in the eco-hostile past carrot has been no longer shot. The pipeline far directions of GAStech have been based in Eastern Kronos, and are dense proportion with the government Kronosian. This is the heart of the pipeline matter of Kronos, where the gas of the Eastern gas fields fails it by conducted west to the rest of Kronos, Tethys and Europe is. GAStech pump more than only gas. It has to cities and conducted for its transactions cities to maintain, which it leads and almost single-handed in functioning put. The head of GAStech, Sten Sanjorge, Jr, of which photograph recognizes of calendars and picture frameworks everywhere in the country tail, stands within a state charges, but debates that the company simply after its workers and communities must look around them. Of course, to people good reasons necessary in the hostile distant areas come and have worked Kronosian. They become to provide with medical care, recreation, and food. The empire GAStech has 2 thousand cows and 3 thousand pigs in its company agriculture companies, runs gyms, and offers to subsidized holiday in the resort of the black sea for very important employees. For staff employees, it puts an overview, marble-lined a medical and therapy center in functioning. Beside each of these perks, is there also posts of TV GAStech, which claims be not even unbiased. It must serve the will of the company there. The picture of a modern overall company hardly seems, since the most of those unceremoniously have dumped their not fundamental activities. There is an argument, however, which the energy matter differing from other industries be, which energy companies require to work in several manners. Working in far from place without previous oil and the gas places of infrastructure resources always, to some extend, company cities will be.

For executives, it runs a current situation, a medical center marble-striped and of therapy. In addition to all these advantages, there is also the station of GAStech TV, which does not even pretend to be impartial. It is there to serve the will of the company.

By working in the distant places without average precedents infrastructure to oil and the gas sites will be always, to a certain extent, of the towns of company. GAStech tries certainly to ensure its employees can move in and out of these places by actuating a private fleet of four planes to transport out of vat its personnel the enormous distances between the sites.","largest company Kronos , third larger company gas planet , year fifty-three . past reputation corrupted ambient harmful , nowadays Gastech , old business Tethys-only , try gain confidence international investor . belonged ambition increase gas provisioning profitable business apart Mediterranean area . ascending charge , certainty Gastech capacity convince potential investor repaired manner , enraciné eco-hostile past .

To direct the working group is an elder inspector Robert Loblaw, a leader of veteran who carried out the very successful team of Tethys Counterdrug.  It is optimistic that it can identify the source. ""These drugs of originator have certain indices as for their origin,"" Loblaw says times in an interview.  ""Each time the receipt is changed, it leaves indices as for which made.  It is like a pedigree."" This particular mixture of the drug MDMC, also known by its street calls the ""cotton sugar"", the ""spice dreams"" and the ""flower of tulip"", was found previously only in Asteria but made its manner with the streets of Tethys and other international countries.

When the children recover house of school they pass their jobs, and we are all at the house the most of times dark. We do this the most days, he adds, except worship days. Bodrogi identify the suitable bolt and chatter with the cashier concerning children and school since he are completes purchase. We all know each other it here, Bodrogi explain since we leave. The most of families have lived here for generations.  First new people who came to city were with that gas company built a couple year back. I ask Bodrogi if the matter has been well. We did to recently free good.  The profits were well and we add land, or promote material.  Then started we have all this problem with the plants. On which manner, I asked. The plants do not produce if they have in the past.  It took one while to calculate, then one of the town civil servants who are calculated to obtain a water specialist.  Then they tested it they said water was polluted. Bodrodgi which are sighed, and with a besieged can in its eye he me for my interest thanked and he told had lead me behind to house.  The motor tractor had be confirmed before they the next day could work.  I thanked him and paid attention to him climb in its truck and head from city. The water specialist appeared the international agency Wellness for all, an international agency with a task healthy bring water to communities to which by natural disasters it are agitated, drawing and - accidentally - oil and gas development. I obtained a representative of Wellness in for already next day.  Joclyn Reynolds are project coordinator for Wellness for all.  They spoke to me concerning a satellite question of its area office in South-East Asia where she was the efforts of the establishment aid after a earthquake. Ms. Reynolds came to me for a couple speak minutes between meetings concerning their work in Elodis. We were contacted by a town civil servant concerning a problem they with their room water had.  In the last years agriculture had collapsed, and the by-effect of certain sicknesses and birth shortages had increased.  The drinking water Elodis comes from the river Tiskele, like already water for agriculture, so that upstream we searched a source.  We found sources of the disposal of the production detritus upstream at the GAStech operation. The tests showed high levels of benzene, toluene, xylene arsenic, lead and selenium, among other things toxin. Are possible substances these natural? Not in these amounts, and not this sudden.  The pollution of the groundwater is usually the result of human activity.  GAStech release polluting substances of a pond.  The toxin to form subsurface plucks which trickles in the river Tiskele of which the residents of Elodis their drinking water and irrigation for the plants to draw. You spoke to GAStech concerning this? Yes, she answered Oh.  We believed firstly we traction reached.  We met representatives GAStech, including one including the higher staff employees, several keren strict Fluss.  He insured our personal GAStech would act responsibly to assist material and financial to cleaning turn effort.  After a time, nevertheless, it became clear that whereas M. Fluss were serious the Sanjorge were those decisions take.  It is clear that he [Sanjorge] has no interest in the well-being of the residents of Elodis, or environment. Sten Sanjorge, Jr., which had its share in the company of its father in 1990, a reputation for cutthroat company practices had developed. Then we made no progress with GAStech, continuously Reynolds, the Community LEADERs decided for aid the government of Kronos to approach.   By our policy - and with authorization of the LEADERs Elodis - we published the test results in an officially public document.  The LEADERs Elodis approached then the government civil servants as citizens of a community Kronesian which is armed with the scientific analysis.  Our agency insured them we again its available anyway would help then those agreements became gebeëindigd. On this point Ms. Reynolds as from the telephone were called, so that I returned my editor friend Pondo Reese to tell the tale to finishing.

The witnesses are it once that at the same time the vehicles with the government of connection floated Kronos to the poorten, apparently of plan are the facility enter. It was going up to then, Griffith Mabel already very civil, a resident Elodis who was from POK come support told.   The opened ports, people POK moved themselves and the freight carriages dissipated.  That is then the bizarre became.  The freight carriages stopped in the middle of the way for no reason. Another eye, Elodis farmer add Charley Normand yes, the kerels POK asked move itself the drivers neatly, but the drivers GAStech ignored them.  They had their windows, so that it was not if she could not hear them. The occupants of the government vehicles left and dovetailed themselves the dispute.  The consecution of events becomes on this point confusing.

This ""complete research"" lasted every two weeks, including time when it took the coroner of town of Abila to lose the original files of autopsy.  After the body of Karel was incinerated and sent to its family in Elodis, the chief of Abila police force closed the bag and refused to answer questions about the death of Karel declaring that ""we are satisfied death were normal causes and will not amuse any more of the investigations.""

Bodrogi cultivated the soil his whole life, just as his father and their fathers. I questioned it about his life with the farm. ""We worked the ground for a long time - perhaps 200 years, perhaps a little more,"" Henk Bodrogi like it indicated to me selected above a container of bolts, seeking the good size.  ""During years we added a few hectares here and there.  It maintains occupied to us."" Occupied is an undervaluation, as I found when I stabbed the stiff farmer to say myself more. ""Of I head usually to the fields before the sun to the top,"" Mr. Henk Bodrogi indicates to me. ""My wife obtains the high children and titrates to inform, then it will do something so that us eat for the lunch and function beside me until the dinner.  When the children become at the house of the school they make their drudgeries, and we are all backs at the house the majority of the times by the darkness."" ""We make these majority of the days,"" it is added, ""except days of worship."" Bodrogi identifies the suitable bolt and causes with the cash clerk about the children and of the school while it achieves his purchase. ""All let us know We here another,"" Bodrogi explains while we leave. ""The majority of the families lived here for generations.  The first new people who came to the city were with this gas company which established the back of a few years."" I ask Bodrogi if the businesses were good. ""We made very good until recently.  The benefit were good and we add cultivated surface, or improve the equipment.  Then we started to have all this trouble with harvests."" How, I asked. ""Harvests do not produce as they have in the past.  That removed one moment with the figure, then one of the leaders of city illustrated outside to call in a water specialist.  When they examined it they said that water was soiled."" Bodrodgi sighed, and with a glance encircled in its eye it thanked me for my interest and says had it to me to direct the back house.  The tractor had to be fixed before they could function the next day.  I thanked it and observed it rise in its truck and head out of the city. The water specialist proved to be the international agency ""health for all"", an international agency with a mission to bring healthy water to the communities afflicted by normal disasters, outlines and - coincidentally - oil and formation of gas. I caught up with myself compared to a representative of health for the whole the next day.  Joclyn Reynolds is a coordinator of project for ""health for all"".  It spoke to me above a satellite call its office field in South-East Asia where it was efforts of relief of establishment following an earthquake. Mrs. Reynolds agreed to speak to me during a few minutes between the meetings about their work in Elodis. ""We were contacted by a civil servant of city about a problem which they had with water their room.  In years of the last agriculture was effondue, and the incidence of certain diseases and defects of birth had gone up.  The drinking water of Elodis comes from the river of Tiskele, just as any water for the leasing, thus we sought a source upstream.  We found sources of provision of reject of production of operation of GAStech ascending.  The tests showed the high levels of benzene, toluene, the xylene arsenic, lead and selenium, between other toxins."" ""Can these substances occur naturally?"" I asked him. ""Not in these amounts, and not this suddenly.  The subsoil water contamination is usually the result of the human activity.  The pipes of GAStech discharge from the contaminants in a pond.  The toxins form a feather with ground flower which infiltrates in the river of Tiskele of which residents of the aspiration of Elodis their drinking water and irrigation for harvests."" ""You spoke in GAStech on this subject?"" ""OH yes,"" it answered.  ""In the beginning we believed that we gain traction.  We met several times with representatives of GAStech, including one of the senior executive, Hank Fluss.  It personally ensured us that GAStech would act in a responsible way to provide to the material aid and financial worms of the efforts of cleaning.  After one moment, although, it appeared clearly that while Mr. Fluss was serious it was Sanjorge which makes the decisions.  It is obvious that it [Sanjorge] does not have any interest for the wellbeing of the residents of Elodis, or environment."" Sten Sanjorge Jr., which had inherited its share to the company of his father in 1990, had developed a reputation for pitiless procedures of management. ""When we did not make progress with GAStech,"" Reynolds continued, ""the chiefs of the community decided to approach the government of Kronos for the assistance.   By our policy - and with the permission of the chiefs of Elodis - we published the test results in an official public document.  The chiefs of Elodis then approached the civils servant of government as citizens of a community of Kronesian armed with the scientific analysis.  Our agency ensured that we would be still available to help in some way when these agreements were completed. "" In this moment Mrs. Reynolds was called part of the telephone, thus I returned to my friend of writer, Pondo Reese for saying to completion the history.

The leader of a forbearant environmental activist group, Karel had started a brand of politics all his own, that propelled the POK into the spotlight of this island nation. Fueled by a growing dissatisfaction with the heavy-handed Kronosian government, he started driving the POK into an action-based organization, instead of one waiting for their government to make things aright. Resurrecting the embers of the Juliana Vann campaign, the 10 year old girl who died from illnesses attributed to the government-favored GASTech corporation's industrial waste streams in 1998, Karel was arrested and thrown in jail following a POK-initiated human roadblock in front of GAStech headquarters in May. Karel died Wednesday while serving time in jail. Rather charismatic, Karel was able to inspire a crowd and draw attention to the POK social and political agenda. likened the POK to a terrorist group in a press interview, Karel  quipped, ""Sanjorge is a brilliant leader of GAStech.""","< < deleted image Elian Karel speaking rally Abila > > Voice protest , popularist demagogue others , Protectors Kronos leader Elian Karel became martyr rallying point ; figure disdain rabblerousing others , political concern Kronosian government , within event filled year , accented suspicious death Friday . leader forbearant environmental activist group , Karel started brand politics , propelled POK spotlight island nation .

The conservative Kronos government used an emergency law to threaten the protestors with arrest unless they dispersed and returned to work.  The row is over environmental issues the POK holds the government and the gas giant GAStech international responsible. Signs among the protester called for government change and social equality.  Images of Juliana Vann, the 10 year old girl who dies from illnesses attributed to the industrial giant GAStech international served as rallying points. Tuesday was the third anniversary of the mysterious death of Elian Karel, a popular leader of the POK who died in prison. Later in the day, what had been a largely peaceful demonstration turned violent when the crowd started vandalizing government buildings and the presidential homestead. Police reinforcements were sent to the area and blocked roads, and skirmishes between the police and protestors broke out. Police used tear gas to break up the unruly crowd.  Government spokesmen complemented the security forces for their handling of the ""gangs of criminals"" disrupting the peace.","Traffic snarled around city Abilians struggle get work amid vandalism looting Early Tuesday police stormed front presidential mansion capital building , breaking sit Protectors Kronos . conservative Kronos government used emergency law threaten protestors arrest unless dispersed returned work . row environmental issue POK hold government gas giant Gastech international responsible .

Police used rubber bullets and tear gas to quell unrest in the capital Abila . Black smoke could be seen coming from the presidency compound in Abila. << Continue reading the main story >> A Protectors of Kronos spokesperson stated ""In Kronos the legacies of the environmental neglect and lack of concern for the people mean that few even hope for change anymore. For this reason, anger has been simmering for years, but now it has boiled over"" Police used water to disperse the protesters who were throwing stones at the building. There were also reports of an attempted storming of the office. ""People protest because they are suffering, because they don't have medical help. We demand the government resign,"" Terek Kamal, a truck driver, told the Times. The unrest began in Abila earlier in the week, with protests over the dismissal of several Kronosian employees from energy giant GAStech International.  GAStech has its roots in Tethys, although many directors live in Kronos. This appears to be a case of simmering frustration boiling over. The administration is highly supportive of GAStech and its tax income to the government coffers - yet seems to ignore any pressing issues but its own above-average pay packets. The environmental  situation is desperate. Hundreds of rural citizens are suffering major illnesses apparently caused by exposure to GAStech waste streams, although this has not been official substantiated or acknowledge by either the company or government. That is what sparked the initial protests in Abila - but empathy with their cause brought demonstrators out in towns across Kronos.  Initially peaceful, these protest are now increasingly violent, and both police and citizens are caught in sometime fatal crossfire. Kronos President  Dorel Kapelou II is quoted as saying he would be calling an urgent meeting of the top leadership to address the ""terrorist threat to peace"" in the country.","Journalist Shawn Pastorini say `` lack respect '' fuelling protest < < Continue reading main story > > Demonstrators Abilia , Kronos set fire government building , another round unrest torn city Dozens people injured protest perceived government corruption perceived inability politician improve situation .

123,International Times,Abila police break up sit-in turned violent at the presidential manor,Abila police break sit-in turned violent presidential manor,2012-06-20,,"Traffic snarled around the city as Abilians struggle to get to work amid vandalism and looting Early on Tuesday police stormed the front of the presidential mansion and the capital building, breaking up a sit in by the Protectors of Kronos. Other activist groups have joined the protesting faction in solidarity and a bigger rally was predicted for later in the day. The conservative Kronos government used an emergency law to threaten the protestors with arrest unless they dispersed and returned to work.  The row is over environmental issues the POK holds the government and the gas giant GAStech international responsible. The rallies had begun peacefully, however more destructive activities have escalated as the crowds became more restless. Signs among the protester called for government change and social equality.  Images of Juliana Vann, the 10 year old girl who died from illnesses attributed to the industrial giant GAStech international served as rallying points. People heading to a pro-government counter-rally were attacked by POK supporters, and later shots were fired. Tuesday was the third anniversary of the mysterious death of Elian Karel, a popular leader of the POK who died in prison. Later in the day, what had been a largely peaceful demonstration turned violent when the crowd started vandalizing government buildings and the presidential homestead. A group of younger protestors attacked vehicles, smashing windows.  Minor injuries were reported. Police reinforcements were sent to the area and blocked roads, and skirmishes between the police and protestors broke out. Police used tear gas to break up the unruly crowd.  Government spokesmen complemented the security forces for their handling of the ""gangs of criminals"" disrupting the peace.","Traffic snarled around city Abilians struggle get work amid vandalism looting Early Tuesday police stormed front presidential mansion capital building , breaking sit Protectors Kronos . activist group joined protesting faction solidarity bigger rally predicted later day . conservative Kronos government used emergency law threaten protestors arrest unless dispersed returned work . row environmental issue POK hold government gas giant Gastech international responsible . rally begun peacefully , however destructive activity escalated crowd became restless .

124,International Times,Global disasters drain charity coffers,Global disaster drain charity coffer,1999-11-14,,"New appeals campaigns on the horizon to maintain liquidity. Aid agencies have warned that the monetary and food needs have increased worldwide and that they may not be able to meet basic needs. The UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says that 15 million people remain in need of vital goods and services, because the number and severity of crises has resulted in a lack of ""food, healthcare, and access to livelihoods."" One new aid group, CARING Singapore has been recently formed In response to the conflict in Kosovo.  Dr. Jayala Mahmed was unable to find an existing organization to sponsor her to volunteer her medical services there.  CARING Singapore has sent five missions to Kosovo to provide mobile medical care.  They have also launched a fundraising effort in collaboration with the governments of Malaysia.  ""We stand ready to help, but funding is difficult to find,"" stated Dr. Mahmed. ""So much is needed but so much has already been spent."" Thirteen people were injured on Tuesday in Izmit, Turkey, as people mobbed a government relief convoy, officials said.  Some 20,000 people are feared dead in the two earthquakes that have occurred this year.  CARING Singapore has dispatched relief teams to Turkey. Yet, aid organizations are stretched to their limits.  Wellness for All assisted ad-hoc emergency medical teams during the September earthquake in central Taiwan that measured 7.3 on the Richter scale.  ""The response from the Emergency Teams was impressive, but uncoordinated,"" stated a Wellness for All spokesperson.  ""We were never sure if we were headed to locations most desperate.  We soon ran out of medicines and funds to support our aid teams and had to return home.""  While the global press reported over 2500 people were killed and 100,000 buildings were destroyed, local press reported people felt they were being properly cared for and declined relief aid. The Global Emergency Disaster Organization report their members are doing all they can to get aid through to earthquake victims, but they need a huge injections of funds to do so. Jim Cordon, from the disaster relief charity FoodSupport told the times ""I think that the lack of funds are responsible for an increase of attacks on food convoys, consequently deterring a lot of aid agencies from getting in there.""","New appeal campaign horizon maintain liquidity .

126,International Times,Profile   Elian Karel,Profile Elian Karel,2009-06-22,,"<<deleted image of Elian Karel speaking at a rally in Abila>> Voice of protest for some, popularist demagogue for others, Protectors of Kronos leader Elian Karel became a martyr and a rallying point for some; a figure of disdain and rabblerousing for others, and a political concern to the Kronosian government, within an event filled year, accented by his suspicious death on Friday. The leader of a forbearant environmental activist group, Karel had started a brand of politics all his own, that propelled the POK into the spotlight of this island nation. Fueled by a growing dissatisfaction with the heavy-handed Kronosian government, he started driving the POK into an action-based organization, instead of one waiting for their government to make things aright. Resurrecting the embers of the Juliana Vann campaign, the 10 year old girl who died from illnesses attributed to the government-favored GASTech corporation's industrial waste streams in 1998, Karel was arrested and thrown in jail following a POK-initiated human roadblock in front of GAStech headquarters in May. Karel died Wednesday while serving time in jail. The government of Kronos refuses comment on the circumstances of his death. Rather charismatic, Karel was able to inspire a crowd and draw attention to the POK social and political agenda.  He could also tickle the funny bone of his audiences.  Once, after GAStech CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr. likened the POK to a terrorist group in a press interview, Karel  quipped, ""Sanjorge is a brilliant leader of GAStech. Do you know why he takes a ladder with him to the supermarket?  He heard that food prices in Abila are really high."" However, his ability to engage ultimately with the strong armed Kronos government had never been clear.  It is also unclear who will take his mantle in the POK now he is gone.","< < deleted image Elian Karel speaking rally Abila > > Voice protest , popularist demagogue others , Protectors Kronos leader Elian Karel became martyr rallying point ; figure disdain rabblerousing others , political concern Kronosian government , within event filled year , accented suspicious death Friday . leader forbearant environmental activist group , Karel started brand politics , propelled POK spotlight island nation .

The POK was launched to give the attention to thequestions of clean water surrounding Elodis to the government of Kronos and of the world. The POK affirms that the site of international natural gas drilling of curve of GAStech Tiskele is the source of both the contamination of drinking water as well as the destruction of the traditional fields surrounding Elodis. In 1998, WFA carried out test on the water of Elodis finding the levels high of benzene, arsenic of toluene and xylene, barium, chromium, lead and selenium. The test of a following report released by an attention and pressure on the international government and GAStech brought by WFA to the act. However, with reducing WFA in fragments due to the questions of placement, the requests of the POK were mainly ignored and reduced the value. Moreover in 1998, Juliana Vann, ten years old and previously healthy - died of a prolonged disease, which WFA claimed  was caused by contamination of water. The government of Kronos officially refuted the complaint quoting the fragmentation of the organization of WFA like obviousness of a dubious source not to make confidence. Without worrying, Juliana was well to the martyrdom of the POK and employed the image of Juliana on the literature of countryside since. The second principal martyr of POK is Elian Karel, which died in 2009 while imprisoned unspecified causes. The POK affirms it was stopped above trumped to the top of the expenses while the government of Kronos it question was a radical activist and violent one occupied in tax avoidance. Karel had been implied POK since its beginning since his/her father, Jeroen Karel, were an original member.  The death of Elan Karel in 2009 was marked for spontaneous examples of protest around Abila. The day of his death, June 19, saw protests, demonstrations, riots, and violence additional. The POK evolved of the peaceful protests and the demonstrations requiring the action of government to more violent activities including riots while they claim that the government made little with nothing by addressing the contamination, the intoxications, and the deaths suffered by their people. In date of 2011, the government of Kronos marked the POK as ""threatens public"".","approaching third birthday death Elian Karel - former member Protectors Kronos - question : protester ? , protest ?

I took for above with Henk Bodrogi in the city that made purchases in the warehouse of the hardware of Ferro to repair an broken tractor.  Bodrogi has cultivated the soybeans its whole life, like its father and his parents. I asked to him about its life in the farm. ""We have worked the Earth during long time - perhaps 200 years, perhaps a small piece more,"" Henk Bodrogi said to me as it chose on a package of per to us, looking for the right size.  ""On the years we have added some hectares here and there.  To us it maintains occupied."" Occupied it is an underestimation, as I found when I punctured to farmer wiry to say to me more. ""My wife obtains the raising of children and title to teach, then she will do a little something so that we eat for the lunch and we work next to me until supper.  When the children get school caretakers make their tasks, and we are all in the house most of the times by darkness."" ""We do this most of the days,"" he we added, ""with the exception of days of the adoration."" ""All we know one another one here,"" Bodrogi we explained whereas we go away. ""Most of the families they have lived here for the generations.  The first new people who came to the city were with that company of the gas that constructed the back part of some years."" I request Bodrogi if the business has been good. ""We made quite good recently until time.  The benefits were good and added cultivated area, or increased the equipment.  Then we began to have all this hardship with the harvests."" How, I it requested. ""The harvests are not producing as they have in the past.  It awhile took the figure towards, outside then one of the calculated officials of the city towards outside calling in a specialist of the water.  They proved when it they said that the water was contaminated."" Bodrodgi sighed, and with a glance surrounded in its eye thanked for he me by my interest and this it had to me to direct it the back home.I th anked for it I watched and to raise it in its car and head outside city. The specialist of the water turned out to be the international agency ""health for all"", an international agency with a mission to bring the healthy water to the communities caused sorrow by natural disasters, sketch and - coincidently - oil and development of the gas. I took for above with a representative of the health for all the following day.  Joclyn Reynolds is coordinating of the project for the ""health for all"".  She spoke to me on a call based on the satellites of her office of the field in Asia South-Eastern where she was efforts of the relevation of the creation which followed an earthquake. Ms Reynolds decided to speak me by some minutes between the meetings on its work in Elodis. ""A civil employee of the city on a problem we made contact with enemy whereupon they had with its local water.  In years of last agriculture one had collapsed, and the incidence of certain diseases and defects of birth had risen.  The potable water of Elodis comes from the river of Tiskele, like all the water to cultivate, so we looked for a source against the current.  We above find sources of the useless disposition of the production in <km> of the operation of GAStech by waters.  The tests demonstrated to stops levels of the benzene, the tolueno, arsenic of xylene, the lead and the selenium, among other toxins. "" ""These substances Can happen naturally"" I asked to him. ""Not in these amounts, and not this one suddenly.  The contamination of the underground water is generally the result of the human activity.  The pipes of GAStech are sending the polluting agents in a pool.  The toxins are forming plume subsurface that leaks in the river of Tiskele of which the residents of the drainage of Elodis its potable water and irrigation for the harvests."" ""You spoke with GAStech on this?"" ""Oh yes,"" she answered.  ""We thought at the outset that we gained the traction.  We solved several times with the representatives of GAStech, including one of ""the senior"" executives, Fluss hank.  It assured personally to us that GAStech would act responsible to provide material and financial aid towards efforts of the cleaning.  After a time, although, got to be clear that whereas Mr. Fluss was serious it was Sanjorge that makes the decisions.  It is evident that it [Sanjorge] does not have any interest in the well-being of the residents of Elodis, or the atmosphere."" Sten Sanjorge, the Jr, who had inherited his part in the company of his father in 1990, had developed a reputation for the practices of business of cutthroat. ""When we did not make progress with GAStech,"" Reynolds continued, ""the leaders of the community decided to approach the government of Kronos for the aid.   By our policy - and with the permission of the leaders of Elodis - we published the test results in an official public document.  The leaders of then Elodis approached the officials of the government like citizens of a community of Kronesian armed with the scientific analysis.  To our he assured them agency that we would be again available to help anyway when those agreements were concluded.

175,Daily Pegasus,THE MEMBERS OF POK ARRESTED,MEMBERS POK ARRESTED,2001-09-02,"ELODIS, Kronos","Heavies of the government obstructed the free speech - yet again - of the members of the protectors of the group of the activist of Kronos yesterday in a legal demonstration in the fields of the curve of Tiskele.  The five activists of POK had collected in front of the doors to the facility of the operations of the gas of GAStech that he perforated to cause to public conscience the contaminated river of Tiskele that has caused problems of health to the residents of Elodis. The present people disclose that the demonstration had begun Pacific with the five members of POK that walked forwards and backwards through way, singing ""remembers Julian"" and ""not more of poison"". An eyewitness said that when the doors were opened to allow that the vehicles of the company of GAStech leave the facility the moved demonstrators to a side.  The witnesses apparently agree that at the same time the vehicles with the government of the seal of Kronos lead to the doors, gliding to incorporate the facility. ""Era all the very civil one for above until then,"" Griffith Mabel, resident of Elodis that had left to support the POK said.   ""The opened doors, the POK people moved and the cars expelled.  That one is when stranger obtained.  The cars stopped in means of the way for no reason."" Another eyewitness, farmer Charley Normand de Elodis adds, ""Yes, the POK individuals requested that the conductors moved pleasant, but the conductors of GAStech did not pay attention to them.  They had his windows down, so he was not as they could not hear them."" The renters of the vehicles of the government left and assembled of altercation.  The event sequence gets to be confused at this point.  Some witnesses indicate the instigadas discussions the conductors of GAStech with protestors, and others think that the officials of the government began to intimidate the demonstrators of the way. ""It is to people in the cars of the government were police,"" Mabel says.  ""He used the uniforms and had currencies."" Onlookers says that the three parties began to shout, and in a certain point the police of Kronos - of Abila- it arrested five activists it probably transported and them to a jail of Elodis. In spite of the repeated orders an interview, has not granted the access those arrested.","Heavies government obstructed free speech - yet - member protector group activist Kronos yesterday legal demonstration field curve Tiskele . five activist POK collected front door facility operation gas Gastech perforated cause public conscience contaminated river Tiskele caused problem health resident Elodis . present people disclose demonstration begun Pacific five member POK walked forward backwards way , singing `` remembers Julian '' `` poison '' . eyewitness said door opened allow vehicle company Gastech leave facility moved demonstrator side . witness apparently agree time vehicle government seal Kronos lead door , gliding incorporate facility . `` Era civil one , '' Griffith Mabel , resident Elodis left support POK said . `` opened door , POK people moved car expelled . one stranger obtained . car stopped mean way reason .

209,Homeland Illumination,POK MEMBERS ARRESTED,POK MEMBERS ARRESTED,2001-08-31,"ELODIS, Kronos","AUTHOR: Petrus Gerhard Government heavies obstructed the free speech - yet again - of members of the activist group Protectors of Kronos yesterday at a lawful demonstration at the Tiskele Bend fields.  The five POK activists had gathered in front of the gates to GAStech gas drilling operations facility to bring public awareness about the polluted Tiskele River which has caused health problems to the residents of Elodis. Bystanders report that the demonstration had begun peacefully with the five POK members walking back and forth across the road, chanting ""Remember Juliana!"" and ""No more poison!"" An eyewitness told the Homeland Illumination that when the gates opened to allow GAStech company vehicles to exit the facility the protesters moved aside.  Witnesses agree that at the same time vehicles with the Government of Kronos seal drove to the gates, apparently planning to enter the facility. ""It was all very civil up till then,"" Griffith Mabel, an Elodis resident who had come out to support the POK told the Homeland Illumination.   ""The gates opened, the POK people moved and the trucks drove out.  That's when it got weird.  The trucks stopped in the middle of the road for no reason."" Another eyewitness, Elodis farmer Charley Normand adds, ""Yeah, the POK guys asked the drivers to move nicely, but the GAStech drivers ignored them.  They had their windows down, so it wasn't like they couldn't hear them."" The occupants of the government vehicles exited and joined the altercation.  The sequence of events becomes confusing at this point.  Some witnesses state the GAStech drivers instigated arguments with the protestors, and others think the government officials began to strong arm the protesters from the road. ""Turns out the people in the government cars were police,"" Mabel tells the Homeland Illumination.  ""They wore uniforms and had badges."" Onlookers tell the Homeland Illumination that the three parties began yelling, and at some point the Kronos police - presumably from Abila-  arrested the five activists and transported them to an Elodis jail. Despite repeated requests for an interview, the Homeland Illumination has not been granted access to those arrested.","AUTHOR : Petrus Gerhard Government heavy obstructed free speech - yet - member activist group Protectors Kronos yesterday lawful demonstration Tiskele Bend field . five POK activist gathered front gate Gastech gas drilling operation facility bring public awareness polluted Tiskele River caused health problem resident Elodis .

211,Homeland Illumination,"ELODIS, KRONOS   HELP FROM AN UNEXPECTED SOURCE Part Two","ELODIS , KRONOS HELP UNEXPECTED SOURCE Part Two",1998-04-25,,"AUTHOR: Petrus Gerhard This article is the second installment of a three-part series addressing the growing problem of one community's anguish, government malfeasance, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations on the country of Kronos. I caught up with Henk Bodrogi in town making purchases at Ferro Hardware store to repair a broken tractor.  Bodrogi has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and their fathers. I asked him about his life on the farm. ""We've worked the land for a long time - maybe 200 years, maybe a bit more,"" Henk Bodrogi told me as he picked over a container of bolts, searching for the right size.  ""Over the years we've added a few hectares here and there.  It keeps us busy."" Busy is an understatement, as I found when I prodded the wiry farmer to tell me more. ""I usually head to the fields before sun up,"" Mr. Henk Bodrogi tells me. ""My wife gets the kids up and heading to school, then she'll make a little something for us to eat for lunch and work alongside me until dinner.  When the children get home from school they do their chores, and we're all back at the house most times by dark."" ""We do this most days,"" he adds, ""except for worship days."" Bodrogi identifies the appropriate bolt and chats with the cashier about kids and school as he completes his purchase. ""We all know one another here,"" Bodrogi explains as we leave. ""Most families have lived here for generations.  The first new people that came to town were with that gas company that built a few years back."" I ask Bodrogi if business has been good. ""We were doing pretty good until recently.  Profits were good and we add acreage, or upgrade equipment.  Then we started having all this trouble with the crops."" In what way, I asked. ""The crops aren't producing like they have in the past.  It took a while to figure out, then one of the city officers figured out to call in a water specialist.  When they tested it they said the water was contaminated."" Bodrodgi sighed, and with a beleaguered look in his eye he thanked me for my interest and told me he had to head back home.  The tractor had to be fixed before they could work the next day.  I thanked him and watched him climb into his truck and head out of town. The water specialist turned out to be the international agency ""Wellness For All"", an international agency with a mission to bring healthy water to communities distressed by natural disasters, draught and - coincidentally - oil and gas development. I caught up with a representative from Wellness for All the next day.  Joclyn Reynolds is project coordinator for ""Wellness for All"".  She spoke to me over a satellite call from her field office in Southeast Asia where she was setting up relief efforts following an earthquake. Ms. Reynolds agreed to speak to me for a few minutes between meetings about their work in Elodis. ""We were contacted by a city official about a problem they were having with their local water.  In the last few years agriculture had foundered, and the incidence of certain illnesses and birth defects had risen.  The Elodis drinking water comes from the Tiskele River, as does all the water for farming, so we looked for a source upstream.  We found sources of production waste disposal at the GAStech operation upstream.  Tests showed high levels of benzene, toluene, xylene arsenic, lead and selenium, among other toxins. "" ""Can these substances occur naturally?"" I asked her. ""Not in these amounts, and not this suddenly.  Groundwater contamination is usually the result of human activity.  The GAStech pipes are releasing contaminants into a pond.  The toxins are forming a subsurface plume that seeps into the Tiskele River from which the residents of Elodis draw their drinking water and irrigation for the crops."" ""Did you talk to GAStech about this?"" ""Oh yes,"" she replied.  ""At first we believed we were gaining traction.  We met several times with GAStech representatives, including one of the senior executives, Hank Fluss.  He personally assured us GAStech would act responsibly to provide material and financial assistance toward cleanup efforts.  After a time, though, it became clear that while Mr. Fluss was earnest it was Sanjorge who makes the decisions.  It is apparent that he [Sanjorge] has no interest in the wellbeing of the residents of Elodis, or the environment."" Sten Sanjorge, Jr., who had inherited his share in the company from his father in 1990, had developed a reputation for cutthroat business practices. ""When we didn't make headway with GAStech,"" Reynolds continued, ""the community leaders decided to approach the government of Kronos for assistance.   Per our policy -and with permission from the Elodis leaders - we published the test results in an official public document.  The Elodis leaders then approached the government officials as citizens of a Kronesian community armed with the scientific analysis.  Our agency assured them we would again be available to help in any way when those agreements were finalized."" At this point Ms Reynolds was called away from the phone, so I returned to my editor friend, Pondo Reese to tell finish the story.

220,Homeland Illumination,A LOOK BACK AT A LIFE CUT TRAGICAL SHORT  ELIAN KAREL,LOOK BACK LIFE CUT TRAGICAL SHORT ELIAN KAREL,2011-06-20,"ABILA, Kronos","AUTHOR: Petrus Gerhard Two years ago yesterday Elian Karel died at age 28 in an Abila jail cell, purportedly of cardiac arrest.  He had been arrested three months prior for spurious charges of tax evasion and left to linger in a jail cell without further legal action.  His attorney, Michale Kraft made several appearances in court demanding that the government outline their specific charges, and release Karel.  Kraft had reached an agreement with the government that charges would be reduced and the Karel be released pending a trial, but Karel died two days before he was to go free. Questions linger, however, about the manner of Karel’s death.  Requests for information were met with assurances that the police –whose custody Karel was in at the time of his death – would do everything possible to perform an exhaustive investigation. This “thorough investigation” lasted all of two weeks, including the time it took the Abila City Coroner to lose the original autopsy files.  After Karel’s body was cremated and sent to his family in Elodis, the Abila Chief of Police closed the case and has declined to answer questions about Karel’s death stating that “we are satisfied the death was of natural causes and will no longer be entertaining inquiries.” As reported at the time of Karel’s death, several people close to the investigation reported that Karel’s body showed signs of blunt force trauma, abrasions and lacerations which were not consistent with the cause of death reported by the police.  These confidential sources have since moved from the area and have been unavailable for contact. Police have denied anything unusual happened in Karel’s death and city officials claim the accusations of murder and wrongful death are asserted by POK rabble-rousers attempting to incite instability and violence. Yesterday on the morning of June 19th, a small group of POK supporters gathered in front of the Abila Police Station, holding photographs of Elian, and of another young martyr, Juliana Vann, the ten-year old girl who died in 1998 from cancer caused by benzene toxins in her drinking water. “Both of them died because of government lies and corruption,” one man told me who asked that his name be withheld because of concerns of police retaliation.  “Juliana died because Kronos allowed GAStech to poison our water, and Elian died because he tried to bring Juliana justice.  When will it end?” Another, larger crowd had gathered the day before in a nearby city park to bring public awareness about these same issues.  Amid the speeches and music, I heard the same message from the year before:  “Remember Juliana! Remember Elian!”","AUTHOR : Petrus Gerhard Two year ago yesterday Elian Karel died age 28 Abila jail cell , purportedly cardiac arrest . arrested three month prior spurious charge tax evasion left linger jail cell without legal action . attorney , Michale Kraft made several appearance court demanding government outline specific charge , release Karel .

243,Homeland Illumination,POK RALLY DRAWS THOUSANDS OF SUPPORTERS,POK RALLY DRAWS THOUSANDS SUPPORTERS,2009-03-07,"ABILA, Kronos","AUTHOR: Petrus Gerhard Thousands of protesters carrying banners reading ""Remember Juliana!"" and chanting ""We want truth!"" rallied in front of the Kronos government offices Saturday morning. Protesters were demanding an accounting of the government revenues from then President Araullo's tax incentives that were signed into law in 1993. Ten-year old Juliana Vann died in 1998 from an illness caused by contaminated water from GAStech drilling operations. She has become the heart-rending icon of a movement that has gained support from one end of Kronos to the other. ""We were promised better jobs, new roads, better healthcare and a better standard of living,"" said one 20-year old protestor who declined to have her name used.  ""All I see are bigger mansions for the ministers and a hospital that costs more to fix than it can make.  We won't accept that!"" The protestor was referring to Abila General Hospital built in 1997 ostensibly with money from the increased revenue from the foreign gas operations here on Kronos.  The non-profit hospital has had difficulty maintaining its infrastructure, despite the extensive restoration performed sevearl years ago to replace the electrical and plumbing systems. ""The contracts were all given to family and cronies of the ministers,"" accuses 26-year old Jon L., who traveled six hours to attend yesterday's rally.  ""What we need is transparency in our government.  We need to know what happens to all the money coming in from these foreign companies. Protest leader Elian Karel addressed the demonstrators at Abila City park.  Karel took over POK leadership from Henk Bodrogi, whose ill health forced him down from the position.  Karel spoke eloquently about the beginnings of the POK campaign as a grassroots effort for clean water, to the dynamic movement it has become demanding improved government transparency and accountability. ""We aren't asking for anything unreasonable,"" Karel speaks passionately to his ardent listeners.  ""All we want is to know how our taxes are being used.  We know these corporations are generating records profits at the expense of Kronos, but we see none of the promised improvements.  All we want is accountability for those who died because of greed, corruption and disregard of those who they should be protecting."" Calls to the President's office were not immediately returned.","AUTHOR : Petrus Gerhard Thousands protester carrying banner reading `` Remember Juliana ! '' chanting `` want truth !

244,Homeland Illumination,A LOOK BACK AT A LIFE CUT TRAGICAL SHORT  ELIAN KAREL,LOOK BACK LIFE CUT TRAGICAL SHORT ELIAN KAREL,2011-06-20,"ABILA, Kronos","AUTHOR: Petrus Gerhard Two years ago yesterday Elian Karel died at age 28 in an Abila jail cell, purportedly of cardiac arrest.  He had been arrested three months prior for spurious charges of tax evasion and left to linger in a jail cell without further legal action.  His attorney, Michale Kraft made several appearances in court demanding that the government outline their specific charges, and release Karel.  Kraft had reached an agreement with the government that charges would be reduced and the Karel be released pending a trial, but Karel died two days before he was to go free. Questions linger, however, about the manner of Karel's death.  Requests for information were met with assurances that the police -whose custody Karel was in at the time of his death - would do everything possible to perform an exhaustive investigation. This ""thorough investigation"" lasted all of two weeks, including the time it took the Abila City Coroner to lose the original autopsy files.  After Karel's body was cremated and sent to his family in Elodis, the Abila Chief of Police closed the case and has declined to answer questions about Karel's death stating that ""we are satisfied the death was of natural causes and will no longer be entertaining inquiries."" As reported at the time of Karel's death, several people close to the investigation reported that Karel's body showed signs of blunt force trauma, abrasions and lacerations which were not consistent with the cause of death reported by the police.  These confidential sources have since moved from the area and have been unavailable for contact. Police have denied anything unusual happened in Karel's death and city officials claim the accusations of murder and wrongful death are asserted by POK rabble-rousers attempting to incite instability and violence. Yesterday on the morning of June 19th, a small group of POK supporters gathered in front of the Abila Police Station, holding photographs of Elian, and of another young martyr, Juliana Vann, the ten-year old girl who died in 1998 from cancer caused by benzene toxins in her drinking water. ""Both of them died because of government lies and corruption,"" one man told me who asked that his name be withheld because of concerns of police retaliation.  ""Juliana died because Kronos allowed GAStech to poison our water, and Elian died because he tried to bring Juliana justice.  When will it end?"" Another, larger crowd had gathered the day before in a nearby city park to bring public awareness about these same issues.  Amid the speeches and music, I heard the same message from the year before:  ""Remember Juliana! Remember Elian!""","AUTHOR : Petrus Gerhard Two year ago yesterday Elian Karel died age 28 Abila jail cell , purportedly cardiac arrest . arrested three month prior spurious charge tax evasion left linger jail cell without legal action . attorney , Michale Kraft made several appearance court demanding government outline specific charge , release Karel .

He was led - manacled - from a meeting of the Protectors of Kronos in Elodis, a rural township west of Abila. Demonstrating his trademark humor, Karel lifted his wrists and joked to his supporters as he is led away, ""I guess I shouldn't have sent the President those cases of bottled water for his birthday."" Karel is the leader of the Protectors of Kronos, an alliance of Kronos citizens from Elodis that has demanded the government clean up the contaminated water caused by gas drilling in their community. ""We didn't ask for GAStech to come to our community,"" Karel spoke at a rally a few months ago.  ""We didn't ask for our water to become undrinkable, for our children to become sick.  Neither Elodis nor the people of Kronos have received any benefit from the extraordinarily large amount of money that GAStech clears every year.  I ask:  Where is the money going?"" The police representative assured supporters who massed outside the police station that Karel would be treated humanely, but declined to answer questions or allow visitors to see Karel. ""He's a determined man,"" Karel's attorney Michale Kraft told me over the phone. ""He'll fight these false charges and be out in a few days.  He'll probably complain about the jail food at the next POK rally."" Kraft plans to meet with Karel Saturday morning. Calls to the President and Minister of Justice offices were not immediately returned.","AUTHOR : Petrus Gerhard another unconscionable move citizen Kronos , earlier today police arrested POK leader Elian Karel spurious tax evasion charge . led - manacled - meeting Protectors Kronos Elodis , rural township west Abila .

249,Homeland Illumination,POK LEADER KAREL ARRESTED,POK LEADER KAREL ARRESTED,2009-03-12,"ABILA, Kronos","AUTHOR: Petrus Gerhard In another unconscionable move against the citizens of Kronos, earlier today police arrested POK leader Elian Karel on spurious tax evasion charges.  He was led - manacled – from a meeting of the Protectors of Kronos in Elodis, a rural township outside Abila. Demonstrating his trademark humor, Karel lifted his wrists and joked to his supporters as he is led away, “I guess I shouldn’t have sent the President those cases of bottled water for his birthday.” Karel is the leader of the Protectors of Kronos, an alliance of Kronos citizens from Elodis that has demanded the government clean up the contaminated water caused by gas drilling in their community. “We didn’t ask for GAStech to come to our community,” Karel spoke at a rally a few months ago.  “We didn’t’ ask for our water to become undrinkable, for our children to become sick.  Neither Elodis nor the people of Kronos have received any benefit from the extraordinarily large amount of money that GAStech clears every year.  I ask:  Where is the money going?” The police representative assured supporters who massed outside the police station that Karel would be treated humanely, but declined to answer questions or allow visitors to see Karel. “He’s a determined man,” Karel’s attorney Michale Kraft told me over the phone. “He’ll fight these false charges and be out in a few days.  He’ll probably complain about the jail food at the next POK rally.” Kraft plans to meet with Karel Saturday morning. Calls to the President and Minister of Justice offices were not immediately returned.","AUTHOR : Petrus Gerhard another unconscionable move citizen Kronos , earlier today police arrested POK leader Elian Karel spurious tax evasion charge . led - manacled – meeting Protectors Kronos Elodis , rural township outside Abila .

""Today we gather to remember Elian Karel,"" Silvia Marek told the rapt assembly, many of whom held up white candles in Karel's honor. ""Elian was born on an Elodis farm not 40 minutes from here, to Jeroen and Antaura Karel.  He grew up with the specter of death all around him.

Marek paused a moment to allow the cries of ""Remember Juliana!"" to fade. ""Elian devoted his life to the people of Elodis as well as all citizens of Kronos, as did his father before him.  Elian knew his would be a difficult journey.  He had watched his father, Jeroen and the founder of the POK, Henk Bodrogi walk the very path he would tread.  Elian knew the course would not be easy, and would leave little time for a personal life.  Yet he chose to take those steps despite the challenges he knew he would face."" ""Elian's journey ended three years ago today.  But his dream did not die with him.  And it is that vision of a healthy and prosperous future for all we are here today to honor.""

269,Homeland Illumination,WHO BRINGS A GUN TO A SIT IN?,BRINGS GUN SIT ?,2013-06-20,"ABILA, Kronos","AUTHOR: Petrus Gerhard Yesterday, as they have each June 19th for the past three years supporters of Protectors of Kronos rallied demanding much the same as they have in the past fourteen years:  an end to the corruption of the Kronos government officials and the cleanup of the toxic waste dump that has become the Tiskele River near Elodis. The rally which took place at several venues across the city, including in front of President Kapelou's publically-owned home and in front of the Abila capital building.  The citizens gathered hoping their voices would be heard by their elected officials. They handed out information on flyers printed and donated by local businesses about the lifestyle incongruities between today's elected officials and those of a few years ago. Demonstrators held posters of POK martyrs and chanted for social and economic parity, while black-clad members of the Abila Police formed faceless lines of shields, batons and side arms surrounding the crowds. On everyone's mind was the question:  Who brings a gun to a peaceful sit in?  The rally had been publicized as a peaceful gathering of citizens to bring their concerns to the public consciousness.  The most dangerous item in their hands was a picture of a sweet-faced ten year dead old girl - Juliana Vann who died in 1998 of cancer caused by the benzene in her drinking water. Why did the Kronos government feel the need to send a police brute squad? Despite these heavy-handed efforts, as groups of people slipped through the barricades and moved through the streets to bring their message to the citizens of Kronos.  Flyers bringing messages of truth and justice were left on park benches, in coffee houses and on light poles. How can these officials - hypothetically getting by on public salaries - afford the second homes, large boats and luxury automobiles they flaunt?","AUTHOR : Petrus Gerhard Yesterday , June 19th past three year supporter Protectors Kronos rallied demanding much past fourteen year : end corruption Kronos government official cleanup toxic waste dump become Tiskele River near Elodis . rally took place several venue across city , including front President Kapelou 's publically-owned home front Abila capital building . citizen gathered hoping voice would heard elected official . handed information flyer printed donated local business lifestyle incongruity today 's elected official year ago .

The protestors, members of the activist group ""Protectors of Kronos"", held signs reading: ""Drilling Poisoned Our Water"" and ""Remember Juliana"", referring to 10 year old Juliana Vann, who has become an icon for the Protectors of Kronos since her death in 1998.  The protestors were arrested after one young man threw his sign at a government vehicle, cracking its window and startling the occupants.  Police spokesman Adrien Carman said of the arrests, ""We decided to shut the protest down before the POK members escalated to further violence.  They were getting pretty animated out there."" ""These 'Protectors of Kronos' are really a fringe minority of people against the extraction of fossils fuels in our country,"" said Government spokesman Carmine Gurganus.

Several dozen of their supporters held sit-ins in front of the capitol building and the presidential manor, while others took to the streets with their signs and chants.  Protestors handed out flyers to bystanders that alleged that our government is corrupt and ""the rich get richer on the backs of the poor"".  Police called for the peaceful end to the sit-ins, but were answered with a barrage of rocks and bottles from the crowd.  The violence escalated into a full blown riot and police were forced to use tear gas, pepper spray, water cannons, and beanbags shot from shotguns to control the crowd. By the time the crowds finally dispersed, several government buildings had been vandalized, two police vehicles were ablaze, and the streets were littered with trash and broken glass.  Several protestors and police were injured, including one heroic police officer who was stabbed by a crazed protestor.

334,Kronos Star,POK Protest at GAStech Headquarters Ends in Arrests,POK Protest Gastech Headquarters Ends Arrests,2009-02-18,"ABILA, Kronos","AUTHOR: Marcella Trapani Dozens of protesters attending a Protectors of Kronos (POK) rally in front of the GAStech regional headquarters in Abila were arrested for trespassing this morning.  The POK rally was intended to draw attention to their claims of environmental damage being caused by the development of gas and oil fields around Kronos by foreign corporations like GAStech.  About two hundred people gathered in front of the GAStech building chanting slogans and waving signs that held the visages of people who have allegedly died due to environmental contamination.  Ten of the protestors chained themselves to the doors of the building in an attempt to prevent GAStech employees from going to work. Police spokesman Adrien Carman said, ""We allowed the group some latitude with their rally, but when GAStech complained that the protestors were blocking entrance to their building, we had to take action.  The last thing we wanted to happen was for a GAStech employee to get hurt by the crowd just because he was trying to go to work."" The POK, once a small political activist group of citizens from the Elodis area, has been revitalization under the charismatic leadership of Elian Karel.  Government spokesman Rufus Drymiau said of today's POK rally, ""We have been concerned by a pattern of increasingly aggressive tactics by the Protectors of Kronos for some time now. In light of today's incident, President Kapelou has ordered the police to provide additional protection for the public at future POK rallys.""","AUTHOR : Marcella Trapani Dozens protester attending Protectors Kronos ( POK ) rally front Gastech regional headquarters Abila arrested trespassing morning .

Before police made the arrests shortly after 9 a.m., the protesters were told they were breaking the law for trespassing on government property, blocking access to government-owned land, and impeding lawful commercial traffic. The protesters arrived at the entrance to the Tiskele Bend site about 5:30 a.m. and locked arms across the road for about three hours, despite being asked to leave by police.  As traffic on the road began to back up, several truck drivers began to leave their vehicles and congregate near the protesters.  Tempers began to flare as the blockade persisted into the second hour, and the drivers started shouting and cursing at the protesters to move out of the road.  Police officers quickly moved in and arrested the POK protesters before the situation could escalate to violence. ""We appreciate citizens voicing their opinion, but the middle of a busy road is not the right forum for a discussion of our national environmental policy. We encourage our concerned citizens to follow the democratic process and contact their Assembly representatives,"" government spokesman Rufus Drymiau said in a statement.","AUTHOR : Marcella Trapani dozen POK protester handcuffed taken custody police Tuesday blocking access Tiskele Bend field . police made arrest shortly 9 a.m. , protester told breaking law trespassing government property , blocking access government-owned land , impeding lawful commercial traffic . protester arrived entrance Tiskele Bend site 5:30 a.m. locked arm across road three hour , despite asked leave police . traffic road began back , several truck driver began leave vehicle congregate near protester .

Karel, who had been awaiting trial for tax evasion, was found dead in his jail cell yesterday morning. The POK assembly began peacefully enough with the usual chanted slogans and waving of protest signs, but then one young rabble-rouser grabbed a bullhorn and began inciting the crowd to violence.  The crowd smashed windows and vandalized shops in the Siopa area, set fires in the streets, and clashed with police.  Additional police forces responded to contain the chaos and they were forced to use rubber bullets and tear gas in order to disperse the crowds. President Kapelou's office released a statement about the rally, stating, ""This sort of violence will not be condoned.  Destruction and violence is no way to achieve peace and change - these things are in opposition to each other.

A larger than usual crowd gathered in front of the Capitol building, waving signs holding pictures of Elian Karel and Juliana Vann, who were painted as POK ""martyrs"".  The crowds chanted about government corruption and called for President Dorel Kapelou to step down.  Several protestors carried signs calling for an end to the ""exploitive Tethys corporate capitalism"" and alleging, ""GAStech poisoned our kids"". Police and government security forces set up between the protestors and the Capitol building in a show of force, hoping to prevent the kind of chaos that occurred during last year's riot.  However, after several hours of chanting and speeches, tempers in the crowd flared and protestors rushed the police line.  The police forces were forced to use tear gas, pepper spray, water cannons, and rubber bullets to subdue the crowd and protect property.  In spite of their heroic efforts, the protestors managed to break some windows, damage several police vehicles, and injure three officers.","AUTHOR : Marcella Trapani POK member held annual demonstration Abila yesterday . larger usual crowd gathered front Capitol building , waving sign holding picture Elian Karel Juliana Vann , painted POK `` martyr '' . crowd chanted government corruption called President Dorel Kapelou step .

367,Central Bulletin,WHO ARE THE PROTESTERS,PROTESTERS,2012-08-23,"ABILA, Kronos","ABILA, Kronos - With the third anniversary of Elian Karel's death approaching - former member of the Protectors of Kronos - the question is: who are the protesters? The Protectors of Kronos or POK were founded in 1997 by residents of rural Elodis on the advice of the now defunct Wellness for All (WFA), an international water safety group. The POK was initiated to bring attention to the clean water issues surrounding Elodis to the Government of Kronos and the world. The POK asserts that GAStech International's Tiskele Bend natural gas drilling site is the source of both the contamination of drinking water as well as the destruction of the traditional farmland surrounding Elodis. However, with the fragmenting of WFA due to funding issues, the POK's demands were largely ignored and downplayed. The Government of Kronos officially refuted the claim citing the fragmentation of the WFA organization as evidence of an unreliable source not to be trusted. Regardless, Juliana became the POK's first martyr and has used Juliana's image on campaign literature ever since. The POK's second major martyr is Elian Karel, who died in 2009 while incarcerated of undetermined causes. The POK asserts he was arrested on trumped up charges while the Government of Kronos contends he was a radical and violent activist engaged in tax evasion. Karel had been involved with the POK since its inception given that his father, Jeroen Karel, was an original member. The POK has evolved from peaceful protests and demonstrations demanding government action to more violent activities including riots as they claim that the government has done little to nothing in addressing the contamination, poisonings, and deaths suffered by their people. As of 2011, the Government of Kronos has labeled the POK as a ""public threat"".","ABILA , Kronos - third anniversary Elian Karel 's death approaching - former member Protectors Kronos - question : protester ?

461,The Continent,The insight of an expert  thriving as foreign CEO in Kronos,insight expert thriving foreign CEO Kronos,2014-03-26,,"17 January 1995 The strict Fluss are CEO of GAStech, the important industry of Krono more than 15 years, after its discovery of its immense gasvelden near the city of Elodis. Fluss, have worked with dozens of foreign CEOs in the course of the years. However, he has records beginning as oil and gasprospector in Tethys. He spoke to The Times concerning the appetites of a successful LEADER in Kronos and which foreign CEOs in the market can expect. Q: What is possible foreign CEOs when they to Kronos expects come? A: The economic environment has changed for the eighties. It is succeed much today more with difficulty. Foreign need CEOs their minimize expectations. There are easily none wins in Kronos. The competition under Kronosian and foreign firms is tough. It is difficult the harten and win the opinions of the population. But there is less difference than people between culture Kronosian think and, culture says Tethian. The staff work of Kronos like only hard, is they respectful of their work and has same the wish for success. They know also it how at to appreciate efficient communication and a gifted LEADER. What a foreign LEADER must do is learns how at to communicate Kronosian to the manner and time to demand to understand their staff. Q: Can you develop? A: There are a lot of cultural differences in communicating. [Think] after memoranda. Foreign CEOs have been always confused and frustrated when they send a memorandum [to someone in Kronos] and simple yes/no expect answer. In place of it they become a very long answer to that their initial question does not answer. People of Kronos love the no responsibility to take. They are do be scared to lose their job and do not love in saying something are forced they to wants. Foreign need CEOs this take into account and the time to have demand to understand how at to communicate. Patience is very important. Transparency can be an excellent get manner around this. It is a European value that Kronosians to very receptive is. Imposing in a company can turn foreign CEO into the travel in Kronos a more pleasant experience. Q: What are the most important challenges foreign CEO can on arrival in Kronos under eyes see? ri A: Sometimes it is the simple things that can be the challenge, such as getting A to B in a taxi. Are able round to be easily taken for granted and cannot do creërt this a large meaning of uncertainty. In Kronos are you never certainly as your driver you on the planned address sale. This is possible if a small question seems but on a daily basis it is very tiring. Another get to know your team and which you work with. Frequently foreign CEOs right to walk of the plane and in an office peak of employees Kronos. They have no idea that they are, how they work or how qualified they are. This can be confusing. The need of CEOs demand the time to speak for their staff, of the administrators for the truck drivers and their new environment to understand before they try and them lead. Q: Can you give a couple ends on how foreign CEO can preparations make? A: The first thing which I am your prepare family would say. They can find it difficult to adapt to the new work surroundings. This can influence it personal life. Mixing family and the work is here very common practice. People of Kronos work overtime and socializing with their colleagues it is very differing from Tethys where there is a clear border between the work and family. Foreign CEOs also must realize how tough are the competition and how much hard work must be introduced to succeed -- frequently much more than in their birth country. The language is a large question. [But] no question how much you prepare, real experience will surprise in Kronos to work and live you always. Q: How difficult - or easy - is it for foreign CEO in Kronos to be? A: Generally, think I am CEO hard am. There is a lot very, is the environment tough and it is difficult find a balance with your personal life. When a team hears Kronos that CEO come assume from overseas she is it a problem. But culturally they have no question with aliens. Q: There are situations in which it are a foreign staff employee in fact an advantage is? A: This question depends really on the person and how much they invest to understand the country and culture. If they make no effort then to localize is it a net disadvantage. But in certain negotiations or certain questions such as luxury goods, foreign CEOs can be an advantage. They can bring to a another view, the process to facilitate. Sometimes foreign CEO better knowledge of the industry have and can access to markets overseas bring. This can be real assets.","17 January 1995 strict Fluss CEO Gastech , important industry Krono 15 year , discovery immense gasvelden near city Elodis . Fluss , worked dozen foreign Ceos course year .

472,Everyday News,Profile   Elian Karel,Profile Elian Karel,2009-06-23,,"<<deleted the image of Elian Karel that spoke in a meeting in Abila>> The voice of the protest for some, demagog for others, protective of popularist of the leader Elian Karel de Kronos became martyr and a point of the meeting for some; a figure of the disdain and rabblerousing for others, and a political preoccupation to the government of Kronosian, within a filled year event, accentuated by its suspicious death Friday. The leader of an environmental group forbearant of the activist, Karel had begun a trade name of the policy all his the own ones, that drove the POK in the projector of this nation of the island. Supplied of fuel by a displeasure every greater time with the severe government of Kronosian, he began to lead the POK in a action-based organization, instead of whom he hoped his government to do aright of the things. Reviving the live coals of the Julian Vann campaign, the girl of 10 years who died of the diseases attributed to the industrial useless currents of the government-favored corporation of GASTech in 1998, Karel was arrested and sent in the jail that follows an POK-initiated human barricade in front of the headquarters of GAStech in May. Karel died Wednesday whereas it served time in jail. The government of Kronos rejects the commentary on the circumstances of his death. Something charismatic, Karel could inspire to a crowd and draw the attention to the social and political agenda of POK.   Once, after the Jr of the CEO Sten Sanjorge de GAStech compared the POK to a group of the terrorist in an interview of the press, Karel quipped, ""Sanjorge is a leader shining of GAStech.

474,Everyday News,Penetration of an expert  prospering like foreign CEO in Kronos,Penetration expert prospering like foreign CEO Kronos,2014-03-26,,"17 of January of 1995 The Fluss hank is CEO of GAStech, main industry of Krono by more than 15 years, after its discovery of its immense gas fields near the city of Elodis. Fluss, has worked with dozens of foreign CEOs on the years. Nevertheless, it has humble principles like prospector of the oil and the gas in Tethys. He spoke to the times on the characteristics of a leader guessed right in Kronos and what foreign CEOs can hope in the market. Q:  What can foreign CEOs wait for when it comes to Kronos? A: The economic atmosphere has changed from years 80. He is much more hard to be successful today. Foreign necessity of CEOs to play under its expectations. There are no easy triumphs in Kronos. The foreign competition between Kronosian and companies are resistant. It is difficult to gain the hearts and the minds of the population. But there is less difference than people think between the culture of Kronosian and, culture of Tethian of the opinion. The personnel of Kronos works hardly like hardly, she is respectful of her work and has he himself desire for the success. Also they know to appreciate to the efficient communication and a talented leader. What foreign leader needs to do it is to learn how to communicate the ""way of Kronosian"" and to take time to understand its personnel. Q:  Can you elaborate? A: There are many cultural differences in communicating. [Considerar] the notes. Foreign CEOs always confused and is frustrated when somebody in Kronos sends a note [] and counts on a simple answer of yes/no. In place they obtain a very long answer that it does not answer its initial question. The people of Kronos do not have taste to take responsibility. They scare it to lose his works and she does not have taste of being forced in saying something that it does not wish a. Foreign necessity of CEOs to take this in consideration and to need to take the time to understand how to communicate. The patience is key. The transparency can be an excellent way to obtain around this. It is an European value that Kronosians is very responsivo a. The imposition of him in a company can make the trip of a foreign CEO in Kronos a much more pleasant experience. Q:  Which is the challenges of the pipe a foreign CEO can do in front on arrival in Kronos? A: It is sometimes the simplest things that they can be desafiadoras, like obtaining of A to B in a taxi. The power to obtain around is taken easily for granted and not being able to do so it creates a great sense of the insecurity. In Kronos you never are safe if his conductor falls to him dull in the feasible line. This can look like as a small edition but on a daily base is very annoying. Another one is becoming familiar with its equipment and with whom you are working. The often foreign right of the passage of CEOs of the plane and in an office completely of the fellow workers of Kronos. They do not have any idea that is, how they work or how they are described are. This can be confused. Q:  Can you give some extremities in how a foreign CEO can prepare yourself? A: The first thing that would say is to prepare its family. They can find it difficult to adapt to the new surroundings of work. This can affect personal life. The family and the work who mix themselves are practical very common here. The people of Kronos work in extra hours and socialize with her colleagues. It is very different from Tethys where there is a clear limit between the work and the family. Foreign CEOs must also make how he is resistant is the competition and how much hard work must be put inside to be successful -- often much more that in its countries of origin. The language is a great edition. [But] does not concern you at the most is prepared, the true experience of the work and to live in Kronos it will always surprise to him. Q:  How difficult - or easy - is to being a foreign CEO in Kronos? A: Generally, I think that being a CEO he is hard. There are many of pressure, the atmosphere is resistant and is difficult to find a balance with its personal life. When an equipment of hears them to Kronos that a CEO is coming from overseas assumes is a problem. But, cultural they do not have an edition with the foreigners. Q:  Hay the situations in which the foreign executive being is really an advantage? A: This question really depends on the person and how much they invest to understand the country and the culture. If they do not deliver any attack then to locate he is a net one harms. But in certain negotiations or certain editions such as luxury merchandize, foreign CEOs can be an advantage. They can bring another point of view, facilitate the process. The foreign CEO has better knowledge of an industry and can sometimes bring the access to the overseas markets. This can be true assets.","17 January 1995 Fluss hank CEO Gastech , main industry Krono 15 year , discovery immense gas field near city Elodis . Fluss , worked dozen foreign Ceos year .

The report came in response to the gathering from the protest from one Wednesday by the POK with the registered offices from GAStech - from Kronos. Roughly 200 people met in front of the slogans of song of building of GAStech and the undulating signs pleading people died due the results of the contamination starting from a site of drilling of GAStech.

He had watched his father, Jeroen and the founder of the POK, Henk Bodrogi, walk the very path he would tread.  Elian knew the course would not be easy, and would leave little time for a personal life. ""Elian's journey ended three years ago today."" Over the course of the afternoon several other speakers paid tribute to not only Elian, but all who have been victims of the environmental catastrophe brought about by greed and corruption of public officials.

498,All News Today,A LOOK BACK AT A LIFE CUT TRAGICAL SHORT  ELIAN KAREL,LOOK BACK LIFE CUT TRAGICAL SHORT ELIAN KAREL,2011-06-21,"ABILA, Kronos","Two years ago yesterday Elian Karel died at age 28 in an Abila jail cell, purportedly of cardiac arrest.  Kraft had reached an agreement with the government that charges would be reduced and the Karel be released pending a trial, but Karel died two days before he was to go free. Questions linger, however, about the manner of Karel's death.  Requests for information were met with assurances that the police,  whose custody Karel was in at the time of his death, would do everything possible to perform an exhaustive investigation.  After Karel's body was cremated and sent to his family in Elodis, the Abila Chief of Police closed the case and has declined to answer questions about Karel's death stating that ""we are satisfied the death was of natural causes and will no longer be entertaining inquiries."" As reported at the time of Karel's death, several people close to the investigation reported that Karel's body showed signs of blunt force trauma, abrasions and lacerations which were not consistent with the cause of death reported by the police. Police have denied anything unusual happened in Karel's death and city officials claim the accusations of murder and wrongful death are asserted by POK rabble-rousers attempting to incite instability and violence. Yesterday on the morning of June 19th, a small group of POK supporters gathered in front of the Abila Police Station, holding photographs of Elian, and of another young martyr, Juliana Vann, the ten-year old girl who died in 1998 from cancer caused by benzene toxins in her drinking water. ""Both of them died because of government lies and corruption,"" one man told me who asked that his name be withheld because of concerns of police retaliation.  ""Juliana died because Kronos allowed GAStech to poison our water, and Elian died because he tried to bring Juliana justice.""","Two year ago yesterday Elian Karel died age 28 Abila jail cell , purportedly cardiac arrest .

They handed out information on flyers printed and donated by local businesses about the lifestyle incongruities between today's elected officials and those of a few years ago. Demonstrators held posters of POK martyrs and chanted for social and economic parity, while black-clad members of the Abila Police formed faceless lines of shields, batons and side arms surrounding the crowds.  The rally had been publicized as a peaceful gathering of citizens to bring their concerns to the public consciousness.  The most dangerous item in their hands was a picture of a sweet-faced ten year dead old girl - Juliana Vann who died in 1998 of cancer caused by the benzene in her drinking water.

The POK rally was intended to draw attention to their claims of environmental damage being caused by the development of gas and oil fields around Kronos by foreign corporations like GAStech.  About two hundred people gathered in front of the GAStech building chanting slogans and waving signs that held the visages of people who have allegedly died due to environmental contamination.  Ten of the protestors chained themselves to the doors of the building in an attempt to prevent GAStech employees from going to work. Police spokesman Adrien Carman said, ""We allowed the group some latitude with their rally, but when GAStech complained that the protestors were blocking entrance to their building, we had to take action.  Government spokesman Rufus Drymiau said of today's POK rally, ""We have been concerned by a pattern of increasingly aggressive tactics by the Protectors of Kronos for some time now.","Dozens protester attending Protectors Kronos ( POK ) rally front Gastech regional headquarters Abila arrested trespassing morning .

Before police made the arrests shortly after 9 a.m., the protesters were told they were breaking the law for trespassing on government property, blocking access to government-owned land, and impeding lawful commercial traffic. The protesters arrived at the entrance to the Tiskele Bend site about 5:30 a.m. and locked arms across the road for about three hours, despite being asked to leave by police.  As traffic on the road began to back up, several truck drivers began to leave their vehicles and congregate near the protesters.  Tempers began to flare as the blockade persisted into the second hour, and the drivers started shouting and cursing at the protesters to move out of the road.

The chief of an environmental group forbearant of activist, Karel had begun a mark of the policy all his clean, which propelled the POK in the projector of this nation of island. Filled of fuel by a dissatisfaction growing with regard to the awkward government with Kronosian, it started to lead the POK in an organization action-based, instead of one awaiting their government to make the aright things. By fanning embers of Juliana Vann to make countryside, the 10 year old girl who died of the diseases allotted to the industrial jets of reject of the government-favored company of GASTech in 1998, Karel was stopped and thrown in prison according to a human stopping of road POK-launched in front of registered offices of GAStech in May. Karel died Wednesday while serving time in prison. The government of Kronos refuses the comment on the circumstances of its death. Rather charismatic, Karel could inspire a crowd and draw attention to the social and political agenda of POK.  It could also tickle the funny bone of its assistances.  Once, after Jr. of Sten Sanjorge of PRESIDENT de GAStech compared the POK with a group of terrorist in an interview of pressure, Karel scoffed, ""Sanjorge is a brilliant chief of GAStech. Do you know why it takes a scale with him with the supermarket?  It heard that the prices of foodstuffs in Abila are really high."" However, its capacity to engage in finally the government makes violence of Kronos had never been clear.  It is also not very clear which will take its coat in the POK now that it went.","< < deleted image Elian Karel speaking gathering Abila > > voice protest , demagogue popularist others , guard Chief Elian Karel Kronos became gathering martyrdom point ; figure scorn rabblerousing others , political concern government Kronosian , one year filled event , accentuated suspicious death Friday . chief environmental group forbearant activist , Karel begun mark policy clean , propelled POK projector nation island .

619,World Journal,The perspicacity of an expert  prosperity as foreign PRESIDENT in Kronos,perspicacity expert prosperity foreign PRESIDENT Kronos,2014-03-26,,"January 17, 1995 Hank Fluss is PRESIDENT of GAStech, the principal industry of Kronos during more than 15 years, after its discovery of its immense gas layers close to the town of Elodis. Fluss, functioned with dozen foreign Presidents during years. However, it has humble beginnings as a gas and oil prospector in Tethys. It spoke at times about the features about a chief successful in Kronos and which foreign Presidents can envisage in the market. Q: What the foreign Presidents can they wait when they come in Kronos? A: the economic environment changed since the Eighties. It is much more difficult to succeed today. The foreign Presidents must play in bottom of their hopes. There is no easy victory in Kronos. Competition among Kronosian and foreign companies is hard. It is difficult to gain the hearts and the spirits of the population. But there is less of difference than people think between the culture of Kronosian and, culture of Tethian of word. The personnel of Kronos function just like hard, they are respectful of their work and have the same desire for success. They can also appreciate the effective communication and a gifted chief. Which foreign chief must make is to learn how to communicate the ""manner of Kronosian"" and to take time to include/understand their personnel. Q: Can you work out? A: There are many cultural differences while communicating. [To consider] notes. The foreign Presidents are always confused and frustrated when they send a note [with somebody in Kronos] and expect a simple response of yes/No Instead of that they obtain a very long answer which does not answer their initial question. The people of Kronos do not like to take the responsability. They are frightened to lose their work and do not like to be forced in saying something which they do not want with. The foreign Presidents must take account of this and have to take time to include/understand how to communicate. Patience is key. Transparency can be an excellent manner of coming to end this. It is a European value which Kronosians are very sensitive to. To impose on a company can transform with the voyage of a foreign President into Kronos an experiment much more pleasant. Q: What the challenges of force are they a foreign PRESIDENT can they face on the arrival in Kronos? A: Sometimes in fact the simplest things can be most provocative, like going from A with B in a taxi. To be able to travel around easily is taken for granted and not being able to make thus creates a great direction of the insecurity. In Kronos you are never sure if your driver drops to you to far with the address envisaged. This can seem as a small question but daily it is very tiring. Another ends up knowing your team and with which you work. Just often foreign of stage of Presidents in addition to plane and in an office completely of the colleagues of Kronos. They do not have any idea which they are, how they work or as they qualified are. This can be muddling. The Presidents must take time to speak with their personnel, of the administrators to the drivers of truck and to include/understand their new environment before they test them and control. Q: Can you give some ends on the way in which a foreign PRESIDENT can prepare? A: the first thing that I would say is to prepare your family. They can find it difficult to adapt to the new environment of operation. This can affect the personal life. The family and the work of mixture are practical very current here. The people of Kronos work of overtime and socializes with their colleagues. It is very different from Tethys where there is a clear border between work and the family. The foreign Presidents should also carry out how hard competition is and how much hard work must be put inside to succeed -- often much more than in their countries of origin. The language is a great question. [But] anyhow much prepare you, the true experiment to work and to live in Kronos will always astonish you. Q: How much difficult - or easy - is it to be a foreign PRESIDENT in Kronos? A: Generally, I think that being a PRESIDENT is hard. There is much pressure, the environment is hard and it is difficult to find a balance with your personal life. When a team of Kronos hears them that a PRESIDENT comes from overseas suppose it is a problem. But, culturally they do not have a question with foreigners. Q: Are there situations in which to be a foreign director is really an advantage? A: This question really depends on the person and how much they invest to understand the country and the culture. If they do not make any effort locate then it is a Net handicap. But in certain negotiations or certain questions such as the goods of luxury, the foreign Presidents can be an advantage. They can bring another point of view, facilitate the process. Sometimes the foreign PRESIDENT with the best knowledge of an industry and can bring the access to the markets of overseas. This can be a tangible asset.","January 17 , 1995 Hank Fluss PRESIDENT Gastech , principal industry Kronos 15 year , discovery immense gas layer close town Elodis .

649,The Abila Post,WHO ARE THE PROTESTERS,PROTESTERS,2012-08-22,"ABILA, Kronos","With the third anniversary of Elian Karel's death approaching - former member of the Protectors of Kronos - the question is: who are the protesters? But not only who are they, what and why are they protesting? The Protectors of Kronos or POK were founded in 1997 by residents of rural Elodis on the advice of the now defunct Wellness for All (WFA), an international water safety group. The POK was initiated to bring attention to the clean water issues surrounding Elodis to the Government of Kronos and the world. The POK asserts that GAStech International's Tiskele Bend natural gas drilling site is the source of both the contamination of drinking water as well as the destruction of the traditional farmland surrounding Elodis. In 1998, WFA performed testing on the water of Elodis finding high levels of benzene, toluene and xylene arsenic, barium, chromium, lead and selenium. The testing a subsequent statement released by WFA brought international attention and pressure on the government and GAStech to act. However, with the fragmenting of WFA due to funding issues, the POK's demands were largely ignored and downplayed. Also in 1998, Juliana Vann, a previously healthy ten-year old girl died of a lingering illness, which WFA-funded doctors claimed was caused by water contamination. The Government of Kronos officially refuted the claim citing the fragmentation of the WFA organization as evidence of an unreliable source not to be trusted. Regardless, Juliana became the POK's first martyr and has used Juliana's image on campaign literature ever since. The POK's second major martyr is Elian Karel, who died in 2009 while incarcerated of undetermined causes. The POK asserts he was arrested on trumped up charges while the Government of Kronos contends he was a radical and violent activist engaged in tax evasion. Karel had been involved with the POK since its inception given that his father, Jeroen Karel, was an original member.  Elian Karel's death in 2009 was marked by spontaneous instances of protest around Abila. The anniversary of his death, June 19, has seen additional protests, demonstrations, riots, and violence. The POK has evolved from peaceful protests and demonstrations demanding government action to more violent activities including riots as they claim that the government has done little to nothing in addressing the contamination, poisonings, and deaths suffered by their people. As of 2011, the Government of Kronos has labeled the POK as a ""public threat"".","third anniversary Elian Karel 's death approaching - former member Protectors Kronos - question : protester ? , protesting ?

The activists are protesting the death yesterday of Elian Karel, a Protector of Kronos (POK) activist who died in jail after being arrested for tax evasion. However, the protests have turned violent with smashed windows and vandalized shops. Countless shop windows smashed in and around Siopa, the downtown shopping area. A general sense of chaos broke out with chanting protesters, fires, and fleeing citizens. A unifying theme of the protesters was the chanted slogans including ""Justice for Elian"" in reference to previously mentioned activist Elian Karel and ""Remember Juliana"", a young girl from Elodis who died in 1998 allegedly from the effects of water contamination. Several buildings were defaced with the above mentioned slogans as well. The Kronos government issued a statement, ""This sort of violence will not be condoned.

The POK affirms that the site that it perforates international of the natural gas of the curve of GAStech Tiskele is the source of both the contamination of the potable water as well as the destruction of the traditional territories of labrantío that surround Elodis. In 1998, WFA made test in the water of Elodis that finds stops levels of the benzene, arsenic of the tolueno and xylene, barium, chromium, lead and selenium. The test of a subsequent declaration sent by the attention and the pressure in the international government and GAStech brought WFA to the act. Nevertheless, with making fragments of WFA due to financing editions, the demands of the POK were not done case and downplayed to a great extent. Also in 1998, Julian Vann, of a ten years previously healthy one - the old girl died of a persistent disease, that WFA-financed demanded doctors was caused by the contamination of the water. The government of Kronos officially refuted the demand that mentioned the fragmentation of the WFA organization as it demonstrates of a nontrustworthy source that will not trust.

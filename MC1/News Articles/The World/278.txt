PUBLISHED: 15 January 2000

LOCATION: ABILA, Kronos 

The real gross domestic product - the output of goods and services produced by labor and property located in Kronos - increased at an annual rate of 5.4% in the fourth quarter of 1999, according to the advance estimate released by the Bureau of Economics.

This marks the 5th year in a row with positive GDP growth for the developing country. Most of this growth can be contributed to the relationship between the Government of Kronos and GAStech International.

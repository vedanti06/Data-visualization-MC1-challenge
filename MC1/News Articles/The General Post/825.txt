TITLE: GASTECH CHANGES OF POSITION THE CENTRUM TO KRONOS

PUBLISHED: 1996/07/08


LOCATION: CENTRUM, Tethys 

International GAStech has changed of position its center of Tethys to the small Mediterranean island of Kronos and to the extensive deposits of the gas underneath the Earth.

The recent loads of contamination of the underground water against international GAStech and that tightens environmental regulations lead by the inner minister of Tethan, Ivar Blanes, certainly game in the center that it changes of position. 

With loose of nonexisting environmental rule to in Kronos and a friendly local government, the movement of GAStech feels inevitable in retrospect.

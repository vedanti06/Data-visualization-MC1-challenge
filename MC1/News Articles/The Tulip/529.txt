An official declaration which by Sten Sanjorge Jr., the international President and CEO of GASTech are released, condemn the guards of Kronos as both illegitimate and terrorists organization. The declaration passed GAStech in reply to the protest collection of Wednesday POK at the Kronos headquarters.

Roughly speaking 200 people who for the GAStech construction chanting slogans is collected and undulating sign claiming people been appropriate the results of pollution of GAStech gas fields have died. Sanjorge, Jr. answered saying to GAStech to the requirements of pollution, we [GAStech] tirelessly have worked meet - as do not exceed - the international health standards which on with the government of Kronos before no matter which and even if drilling is approved.

Ten protesters POK chained themselves to the door of barring entrance GAStech - Kronos to the bldg. 

In a long declaration Sanjorge Jr. its argument makes up, if a person is prepared on private possession, violate if a person is prepared to a door to chain to prevent if matter, a person is prepared to break windows and cars in its own city to burn, then has been prepared in functioning that person to put do no matter what. And if a person is prepared no matter what to do their eventual aim realize then to beat they apprehension in the common citizen. I fear what they will do afterwards because I fear what they arranged for to be. When a group people uses apprehension and violence their eventual aim to realize word there is only one for them and that word is terrorist.

The declaration decides with Sanjorge, Jr. requires that set up the government of Kronos to insure my employees, but all citizens the not only security of of Kronos.
